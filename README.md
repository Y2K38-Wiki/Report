## Contributions

Right now collecting issues is the best way of helping.

*And correcting collected information.*

### Workflow

- Find issue not yet indexed

- Fork the repository

- Create a new file / change existing in `/Data/Projects/`

- The file should have a readable & related name to the project name

    Replace spaces with `-`

- Use the template found in `/Data/Project-Template.toml`

    Remove sections you don't need / have.

- If possible make one commit for each project / issue / merge

    Add a reference to the issue(s) / merge(s) in the 
    commit description in the following format : 
    
    `<Organization>/<Project>#<Issue/Merge>

    -> `SoftwareMakers/ToolX#234`

- Create a pull request
